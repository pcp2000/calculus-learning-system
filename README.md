# calculus-learning-system
Implement a class which would make calculus learn easily
by certain modules. Here the group members may decide
their working modules.
1) Limits and Continuity (Specific task Group Member-3 )
2) Differentiation Module. (Specific task Group Member-2 )
3) Integration Module. (Specific task Group Member-1 )
For Example
Option-2
 Differentiation Module
1) Direct Formula Based differentiation
a) Enter a character - x
b)Enter power- 5.
 Differentiation of x^5= 5x^4.
2) Differentiation by Parts
3) Differentiation by Substitution.
